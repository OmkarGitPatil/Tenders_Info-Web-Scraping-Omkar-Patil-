# Tenders_Info-Web-Scraping-Omkar-Patil-
This is project in which an attempt us made to scrape the data of important tenders published on websites of Chinese Tenders.
The multiple .py files used to scrape the data because sending to many requests to server at hte same time would leave server to stop working. Each .py file contains code for scraping the data from mutiple urls where each url contains information of one tender. Then this information is stored in the form of .csv file inside the folder CSV file.
List of products is folder which contains .csv files which are actually the information presented in the tabular format on each url. The names of these files are the tender numbers.
The China Bidding Info.csv file is final product of this project where you will find the detailed information of each project stored against its tender number.
